# Traffic-Survival

Personal project I worked on using the C++ SFML game development library. It was an effort to work on something that required some creativity while also exposing myself to OOP concepts in C++. I developed two mini projects in the repo, and one main project which is shown in the image below. The first two were just following tutorials online trying to understand how SFML works, and the main project was built from scratch. This project was built and ran locally on my linux command line (Ubuntu 22.04). X11 forwarding may be necessary for remote use.

To play, run these commands in your terminal:
1) git clone git@github.com:cboumalh/Traffic-Survival.git
2) cd Traffic-Survival/
3) cd src && make
4) cd ../run && ./run_mainproject.sh
6) Play! Use W,A,S,D to move. Game is self-explanatory :)
